Git Hub Guide
I joined the military right out of highschool. After I completed my time in the service I went to work for Toray Carbon Fibers of America. With my first child now and another on the way I had a opportunity at one of the best production jobs in my area. I went to work for Indorama Ventures Xylene and PTA. It is a chemical facility which produces Paraxylene, Purified teraphlactic acid, Purified Isolphlactic acid, and NDC. I worked in the military for 4 years, Toray for 5 years, and I have worked at my current job for 3 years. All my life I have been consumed by work. Plant life and military both require extreme amounts of time dedication, which ulitmately leads to poor work/ life balance. At the age of 29, with a beautiful wife and two children, I have decided to pursue a different career path. I have cousins in the software development / software engineering career field. Their support of their family through hard work, while still maintaining a healthy work/ life balance, has inspired me to learn and understand this career field. Here's to the beginning, of hopefully, a new career. Where I can still support my family financially, yet still be there for birthdays, holidays, and memories that no amount of money can buy back!
